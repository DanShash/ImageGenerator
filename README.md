# ImageGenerator
Hello everyone. This is a little application with the use of StableDiffusion to generate pictures. If you want to try it out, Download/Copy the source code. Also, register on Hugging Face, go to setting's Find Token Generator, and generate your own API token so you can use it. 2nd, make sure your environment in the code editor has downloaded all of the necessary libraries and frameworks for the app to work properly!!! Especially, make sure you download the Pytorch and Cuda that would be compatible. For example: ![image](https://github.com/DanShash/ImageGenerator/assets/93018234/48ecb6e8-229a-4032-b7d5-3d7f95678316)Â 
And here is the CUDA toolkit web page for downloading the correct version. As far as I know, the newest Cuda 13.1 version is not compatible with PyTorch for now.
